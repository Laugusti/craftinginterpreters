Chapter 12 Challenges
=====================

# 1. Add support for "static” methods that can be called directly on the class object itself.

* [Implementation](./static-methods)

# 2. Extend Lox to support getter methods. These are declared without a parameter list. The body of the getter is executed when a property with that name is accessed.

* [Implementation](./getter-methods)

# 3. What are the trade-offs between approaches to accessing an object’s fields from outside of its own methods and why might a language prefer one or the other?
