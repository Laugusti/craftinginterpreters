Chapter 1 Challenges
====================

# 1. There are at least six domain-specific languages used in the little system I cobbled together to write and publish this book. What are they?

* Markdown
* CSS
* Makefile
* YAML
* HTML
* SassScript

# 2. Get a “Hello, world!” program written and running in Java. Set up whatever makefiles or IDE projects you need to get it working. If you have a debugger, get comfortable with it and step through your program as it runs.

* [implementation|./hello-world-java]

# 3. Do the same thing for C. To get some practice with pointers, define a doubly linked list of heap-allocated strings. Write functions to insert, find, and delete items from it. Test them.
